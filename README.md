================
SWeeT Media Link is a Web Application that uses the concept of SWeeTs (Semantic Tweets) in order to link different media like audio, video, PDF etc on the web. These SWeeTs can be stored in a local database (which maintains Unstructured data like MongoDB) or in a SWeeT Repository (which is a big online Database. for example see http://demo.swtr.us).

In order to use this application you need MongoDB 2.4, Python27 with necessary packages (flask, pymongo, lxml.html and so on) installed.

With basic programming knowledge in HTML, CSS, javaScript, Jquery and AJAX, you can read and understand the code. I didn't comment the code as of now (my bad) and I'll do it as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience.
